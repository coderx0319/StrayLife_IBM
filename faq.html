          <div class="text-component">
            <p><br> To change your password, follow these steps:</br>
				<br>1. Log in to the account: Go to the website or application where you have your account and log in using your current username/email and password.</br>
				<br>2. Navigate to account settings: Once logged in, look for an option like "Account Settings," "Profile," or your username/avatar at the top of the page. Click on it to access your account settings.</br>
				<br>3. Find the "Change Password" option: Within the account settings, search for an option labeled "Change Password," "Password Settings," or something similar. It is typically located in the security or privacy section.</br>
				<br>4. Verify your identity: Some platforms may require you to re-enter your current password or provide other authentication methods, such as a verification code sent to your email or phone.</br>
				<br>5. Enter the new password: After verifying your identity, you'll be prompted to enter your new password. Choose a strong and unique password that includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Make sure it's not a password you use on other sites for security reasons.</br>
				<br>6. Confirm the new password: Most platforms will ask you to re-enter the new password to ensure you haven't made any typos.</br>
				<br>7. Save the changes: Once you've entered the new password and confirmed it, click on the "Save," "Update," or "Change Password" button to apply the changes.<br>
				<br>8. Log out and log back in (optional): To verify that your new password works, you can log out of your account and log back in using the updated credentials.
				Remember to keep your new password secure and avoid sharing it with others. Additionally, consider using a password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords for all your online accounts.
				If you encounter any issues or cannot find the password change option, consult the platform's official support documentation or contact their customer support for assistance.</br></p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p> <br>Syncing, short for synchronization, refers to the process of harmonizing data across multiple devices or systems to ensure they have the most up-to-date information. Here's how it works:<br>

				<br>1.Data Exchange: Devices or systems communicate with each other, exchanging information on changes or updates.<br>
				
				<br>2.Comparison: The synced devices compare the data they have to identify any discrepancies.<br>
				
				<br>3.Update: If there are differences, the devices update their data to match the latest version found during comparison.<br>
				
				<br>4.Two-Way Sync: In some cases, syncing works bidirectionally, meaning changes made on any device are propagated to all other devices.<br></p>
