            <p><br> To change your password, follow these steps:</br>
				<br>1. Log in to the account: Go to the website or application where you have your account and log in using your current username/email and password.</br>
				<br>2. Navigate to account settings: Once logged in, look for an option like "Account Settings," "Profile," or your username/avatar at the top of the page. Click on it to access your account settings.</br>
				<br>3. Find the "Change Password" option: Within the account settings, search for an option labeled "Change Password," "Password Settings," or something similar. It is typically located in the security or privacy section.</br>
				<br>4. Verify your identity: Some platforms may require you to re-enter your current password or provide other authentication methods, such as a verification code sent to your email or phone.</br>
				<br>5. Enter the new password: After verifying your identity, you'll be prompted to enter your new password. Choose a strong and unique password that includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Make sure it's not a password you use on other sites for security reasons.</br>
				<br>6. Confirm the new password: Most platforms will ask you to re-enter the new password to ensure you haven't made any typos.</br>
				<br>7. Save the changes: Once you've entered the new password and confirmed it, click on the "Save," "Update," or "Change Password" button to apply the changes.</br>
				<br>8. Log out and log back in (optional): To verify that your new password works, you can log out of your account and log back in using the updated credentials.</br>
				<br>Remember to keep your new password secure and avoid sharing it with others. Additionally, consider using a password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords for all your online accounts.</br>
				<br>If you encounter any issues or cannot find the password change option, consult the platform's official support documentation or contact their customer support for assistance.</br></p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p> Syncing, short for synchronization, refers to the process of harmonizing data across multiple devices or systems to ensure they have the most up-to-date information. Here's how it works:

				Data Exchange: Devices or systems communicate with each other, exchanging information on changes or updates.
				
				Comparison: The synced devices compare the data they have to identify any discrepancies.
				
				Update: If there are differences, the devices update their data to match the latest version found during comparison.
				
				Two-Way Sync: In some cases, syncing works bidirectionally, meaning changes made on any device are propagated to all other devices.</p>

				Incorrect card/PayPal details: Entering the wrong card number, expiration date, CVV, or PayPal login credentials can lead to a failure.

				Security restrictions: Some banks may block online transactions or foreign payments for security reasons.
				
				Billing address mismatch: The billing address provided during payment doesn't match the address on file with your bank or PayPal account.
				
				Daily spending limit: Some banks impose daily spending limits, and the payment might exceed that limit.
				
				Payment gateway issues: Technical problems with the payment processor or the merchant's website can cause payment failures.
				
				Frozen account: If there are suspicious activities or overdue payments, your account may get frozen, preventing transactions.
				
				International transactions: Your card may not be authorized for international payments if the merchant is based in another country.

            <p>Returns or refunds typically work as follows:

				Eligibility: Customers can usually return or request a refund for products that are damaged, defective, or not as described. Some stores may also offer returns for change of mind within a specified time frame.
				
				Timeframe: There is usually a specific period within which returns or refund requests must be made, often ranging from 7 to 30 days.
				
				Condition: The product being returned must be in its original condition with all original packaging and accessories, unless it's a defective item.
				
				Proof of Purchase: Customers will likely need to provide a proof of purchase, such as a receipt or order number.
				
				Refund Method: Refunds are generally issued using the same payment method used for the purchase.
				
				Return Process: Customers may need to initiate the return or refund process by contacting customer support or filling out a return request form online.
				
				Return Shipping: In some cases, the customer may have to bear the cost of return shipping, especially for change-of-mind returns.
				
				Refund Processing Time: The time it takes to process a refund can vary depending on the store's policies and payment method used, but it often takes a few business days.</p>
